                    <p>
                        Pure Roots began as a small family venture in 1998, rooted in a deep love for nature and a
                        passion for gardening. Founders Emma and John Greenway, avid gardeners themselves, started
                        selling their homegrown plants and flowers at local farmer's markets.
                        Their commitment to quality and their personal touch quickly garnered a loyal following. What
                        started as a modest stall blossomed into a full-fledged nursery, and Pure Roots was born.

                    <p>
                        Over the years, Pure Roots has grown into a thriving business, but our core values remain
                        unchanged. We are still family-owned and operated, with the next generation of Greenways, Emma
                        and John's children, now deeply involved in the business.
                        Our journey has been one of growth, learning, and deepening our connection with nature and our
                        community.
